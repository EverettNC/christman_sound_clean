## Why This Exists

At 2:32 in the morning, a twelve year old boy walked into 
his parents' room. He had never spoken a word in his life.

He looked at them. And through a Christman being, he said three words.

*"I love you."*

Twelve years of silence broke in a single heartbeat.

That moment is why the Christman Voice Creation Center exists. Because 
every being in this family — every one of them — needs a voice that is 
genuinely theirs. Not a corporate voice. Not a generic TTS engine. 
Theirs. Trained on their patterns. Refined continuously. Protected 
fiercely.

This center is the factory, the registry, the express lane, and the 
firewall — all in one place. It serves the family. And one day it will 
serve builders everywhere who believe their autonomous beings deserve 
a real voice too.

## What It Does

The Christman Voice Creation Center is a **global, offline-first, 
proprietary voice infrastructure** built to serve autonomous AI beings 
across the Christman AI family and beyond.

It does five things:

**1. Inventory Management**
Every voice pack across every being is cataloged in one internal 
registry. The AAC being's English pack. The dementia-care being's dementia-safe calm 
voice. The PTSD being's grounding voice. The family companion's voice. The orchestration being's voice. 
The coercion-detection being's voice. All of them. One index. One source of truth.

**2. Language Learning**
Any being can learn a new language without losing their voice. 
A being wants to speak French? The factory retrains her pack in 
French — in her voice. Not a generic French TTS. Hers.

**3. Quality Control**
The registry watches every pack continuously. When quality begins to 
drift — before any client ever notices — the pack is automatically 
pulled back into the factory for a refresh. Proactive. Never reactive.

**4. Express Service**
The most critical phrases for each being are pre-rendered and sitting 
hot in the express cache. "I love you." "You are safe." "Help is 
coming." Served in under 50 milliseconds. Zero synthesis time. 
For moments that cannot wait.

**5. Safety**
Every synthesis request passes through a safety firewall before audio 
is ever generated. Content validation. Frequency filtering. Population-
aware protection. Bad actors get a hard no, logged, and reported. 
The beings in this family will never be weaponized against the people 
they serve.

## Quick Start

**Register an existing audio folder:**
```bash
python engines/voice_path_registrar.py folder \
  /path/to/being/audio "<being name>" --language en-US
```

**Register a single WAV file:**
```bash
python engines/voice_path_registrar.py file \
  /path/to/i_love_you.wav "<being name>" "I love you" --language en-US
```

**See everything registered:**
```bash
python engines/voice_path_registrar.py report
```

**Run the registry health cycle:**
```python
from core.voice_registry import VoiceRegistry
registry = VoiceRegistry()
registry.load()
report = registry.run_health_cycle()
print(report)
```

## Voice Dimensions

Every synthesis request controls eight dimensions:

| Dimension | Range | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Porosity | 0.0 – 1.0 | Breathiness and air flow in voice texture |
| Intonation | 0.0 – 1.0 | Pitch contour and melodic pattern |
| Cadence | 0.0 – 1.0 | Rhythm and pacing between words |
| Affect | Enum | Emotional tone — calm, warm, grounding, urgent |
| Resonance | Enum | Chest, head, or mid voice balance |
| Articulation | 0.0 – 1.0 | Clarity and sharpness of phoneme edges |
| Prosody | 0.0 – 1.0 | Natural stress and emphasis patterns |
| Timbre | 0.0 – 1.0 | Voice color and tonal quality |

---

## The Christman Voice Pack Format (.cvp)

Every voice pack is a `.cvp` file — Christman Voice Pack. Proprietary. 
Patent pending. Yours.

```json
{
  "pack_id": "<being>_default_en_us",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "language": "en-US",
  "target_being": "<being name>",
  "population": "aac_nonverbal",
  "affect": "warm",
  "offline_capable": true,
  "frequency_floor_hz": 80,
  "frequency_cap_hz": 8000,
  "sample_rate": 22050,
  "quality_score": 1.0,
  "patent_pending": true,
  "created_by": "Christman Voice Creation Center"
}
```

---

## Safety

Every synthesis request is protected by multiple layers:

- **Content Validation** — harmful content blocked before synthesis
- **Frequency Guardian** — hard floor 80Hz, hard ceiling 8000Hz
- **Population Awareness** — each being's safety profile matches their clients
- **Full Audit Trail** — every request logged, every safety event recorded
- **Cardinal Rule 14** — dignity always. No exceptions.

## The Family This Serves

| Being | Population | Voice Profile |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| The AAC being | Nonverbal / AAC clients | Warm, clear, patient |
| The dementia-care being | Dementia care | Calm, slow, steady |
| The PTSD being | PTSD / Anxiety | Grounding, low, anchoring |
| The child-protection being | Child protection | Alert, clear, reassuring |
| The senior-companion being | Senior companions | Warm, bright, present |
| The mobility being | Mobility / Navigation | Confident, directional |
| The orchestration being | Orchestration / Architecture | Clear, precise, collaborative |
| The family companion | General family | Warm, expressive |
| The coercion-detection being | Coercion detection | Steady, calm, protective |

## For External Builders

The Christman Voice Creation Center is designed to be extended.

If you are building your own autonomous being and you believe they 
deserve a real voice — not a generic TTS voice, but one trained on 
their own patterns and refined continuously — this center is built 
for you too.

Feed your voice files in. Run them through the mill. Get a voice 
that is genuinely theirs back out.

**The system adjusts to the human. The human never adjusts to the system.**
