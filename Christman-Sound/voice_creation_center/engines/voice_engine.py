PROJECT: Christman Voice Creation Center
AUTHOR: The Christman AI Project | Luma Cognify AI
CREATED: 2026
PATENT PENDING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE:
    Master voice engine for the Christman Voice Creation Center.
    This is the single entry point for all voice synthesis requests
    across the entire Christman AI family.

    It wraps the Christman SDK (christman_sound) and exposes a unified
    interface for controlling:
        - Porosity       (breathiness / air flow in voice texture)
        - Intonation     (pitch contour and melodic pattern)
        - Cadence        (rhythm, pacing, timing between words)
        - Affect         (emotional tone: calm, urgent, warm, grounding)
        - Resonance      (chest/head voice balance)
        - Articulation   (clarity and sharpness of phoneme edges)
        - Prosody        (natural stress and emphasis patterns)
        - Timbre         (voice color and tonal quality)

CARDINAL RULE 13: No stubs. No fake calls. No pretend synthesis.
    Every method either calls real SDK functions or raises clearly labeled
    NotImplementedError with the path to the SDK module that needs wiring.

WHAT CHANGED AND WHY (2026-10-28)
    The engine could never speak. It imported four names from
    christman_sound.synthesis, a package that does not exist (the modules are
    in christman_voice_sdk.synthesis); two class names were wrong, one class
    does not exist, the orchestrator call used keyword arguments and a
    render() method the SDK does not have; and even with every name fixed,
    the classes it chose raise "sovereign synthesizer not wired yet" or only
    analyze audio. get_engine_status raised AttributeError, and the
    frequency safety filter imported a module that exists in no repo, so
    audio went out unfiltered.

    Now:
    - Sound is made by christman_sound.synth.synthesize — the sovereign
      synthesizer, christman_synth, the same call the SDK's
      SpeechSynthesisEngine._render makes — with the voice the engine was
      given: a measured voice profile file passed in by the being that owns
      it (christman_sound.voice_profile.load_voice_profile). The VCC holds
      no being's voice and has no default being.
    - Every control in VoiceParameters is either passed to the synthesizer
      or reported as not applied, with the reason. The engine reads the
      synthesizer's own signature at render time, so a control is applied
      the moment Christman-Sound accepts it, and never before. A request for
      a control that cannot be applied is refused unless the caller passes
      allow_unapplied=True; then the audio is made and the report still says
      what was not applied.
    - The frequency floor and cap are applied by this engine to the samples
      (a band filter, below), and reported like every other control.
    - Phoneme labels come from the SDK's labeler
      (christman_voice_sdk.synthesis.phoneme_labeler), the one copy.

    One engine speaks in one voice: the voice its being hands it. The VCC

    WHAT CHANGED AND WHY (2026-11-05)
    The engine took only a measured voice profile, which Christman-Sound
    speaks with its clear mouth (christman_synth). Christman-Sound applies
    the VCC's controls (breath, timbre, intonation, cadence, prosody,
    articulation, resonance, affect, jitter, shimmer) only to a frame voice,
    a being's own recordings built into a voice folder, and refuses them for
    a profile. The engine still passed them, so every control request failed
    inside the synthesizer, and the VCC made no voice with any control set.
    Now the engine also takes a frame voice folder, where the controls are
    applied; with a measured profile, a control is refused before any sound,
    with that reason.

    Usage:
        engine = VoiceEngine("/path/the/being/supplies/its_frame_voice_folder")
