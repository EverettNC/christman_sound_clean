--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE:
    The Express Lane of the Christman Voice Creation Center.

    Two fast tracks:

    TRACK 1 — PRE-RENDERED PHRASE CACHE
        Common, high-frequency phrases pre-rendered per being and stored
        as ready-to-serve audio. Zero synthesis time. Instant delivery.

        Examples:
        An AAC being        → "I love you", "I need help", "I'm hungry"
        A dementia-care being → "You're safe", "Let's go home", "I'm here with you"
        A PTSD being        → "You're not alone", "Breathe with me", "You are safe"
        A safety being      → "Alert sent", "Help is coming", "You are protected"

    TRACK 2 — PRIORITY SYNTHESIS QUEUE
        Requests that can't use pre-rendered audio but need synthesis
        RIGHT NOW. Safety alerts, crisis responses, urgent AAC communication.
        Jumps to the front of the queue. No waiting.

    The express lane never compromises quality or safety.
    It just removes the wait.

CARDINAL RULE 13: No stubs. Pre-rendered audio is real audio.

WHAT CHANGED AND WHY (2026-10-28)
    - The index could not be loaded. Every entry the registrar and the
      ingestor wrote carried "source" and "original_filename", which
      ExpressPhrase did not accept, so load() failed on the committed index
      ("unexpected keyword argument 'source'") and served nothing. There is
      now one entry format, written by one function (register_phrase), which
      the registrar, the ingestor and the studio all call.
    - Nothing in an entry is assumed. Duration and sample rate are read from
      the audio file itself when it is registered, and checked again when the
      index is loaded; an unreadable or empty file is refused. The fixed
      sample_rate 22050 and quality_score 1.0 written into every entry are
      gone: nothing ever measured a quality, so no quality is recorded.
    - Track 2 had no consumer: requests were queued and nothing rendered
      them. process_next() and run_queue() now render each request through
      the requesting being's VoiceEngine, register the result, and
      get_result() returns it.
    - HIGH requests ran last in, first out (each new HIGH was inserted ahead
      of earlier HIGHs). Every priority level is now first in, first out:
      CRITICAL, then HIGH, then STANDARD, then PRELOAD, oldest first in each.
    - No being is written into the VCC. The default phrase table keyed by
      six being names is gone: each being hands in its own phrase source
      (a file), the same way it hands the engine its own voice.
